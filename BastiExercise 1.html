				<h4>Mind, Body, and Spirit!</h4>
				<p>
					I am currently an undergraduate of the University of the Phillipines Los Banos. I am prouldy pursuing the study of computer science and constantly honing my craft in order to elevate my understanding of the world and find my place in it. I am also in the process of sculpting my body to its finest form. I go to the gym regularly in hopes of attaining an artful physique.

			<h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>

			<article>
				<h4>The Only Path</h4>
				<p>
					I have always been interested with computers and games ever since I was a kid. I would tinker with said games and other programs as I could. Imagining myself in the realm of biology, chemistry, physics or other sciences strikes ill of me. To me all of these are inferior, I could only really love the science of computers.
